Asteroids in Elm as a learning exercise

Requires elm 0.18

To get started:
clone the repo
cd to the top level of the repo
type `elm-reactor`
This should respond:
~~~~
elm-reactor 0.18.x
Listening on http://localhost:8000/
~~~~

Open a browser and point it at: [http://localhost:8000/src/app.elm](http://localhost:8000/src/app.elm)
It will take a while to start because it will initially download the elm-package dependencies and compile the code.
